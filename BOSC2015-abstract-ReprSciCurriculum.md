Verifiability and reproducibility are among the cornerstones of the
scientific process. They are what allows scientists to "stand on the
shoulder of giants". Maintaining reproducibility requires that all
data management, analysis, and visualization steps behind the results
presented in a paper are documented and available in full
detail. Reproducibility here means that someone else should either be
able to obtain the same results given all the documented inputs and
the published instructions for processing them, or if not, the reasons
why should be apparent.

Making the computational components of a research study fully
reproducible can be very challenging or even impossible if attempted
post-hoc, such as when prompted by journal requirements or funder
expectations. Yet, there are techniques, tools, and practices that
aleady exist and that stand to help practicing scientists in
organizing, documenting, and automating their digital work so that it
can be more easily repeated and built upon later by others, including
by their future selves. Despite this potential, such tools and
practices are rarely taught, and many biological and other domain
scientists remain unaware of them.

In this talk we report on an effort, the [Reproducible Science
Curriculum Hackathon][3], to develop and teach a 2-day bootcamp-style
workshop curriculum for basic techniques, tools, and best practices
for life scientists that promote the reproducibility of their
computational work from the start. The curriculum is motivated
throughout by reproducibility not primarily for the future benefit of
others, but for the benefit of accelerating one's own research, for
example by more easily repeating and extending analyses with new data,
new tools, or parameter modifications. The effort is an international
collaboration of faculty, bioinformaticians, and IT personnel from
different fields and disciplines, some of whom are actively
prototyping and developing tools to improve the reproducibility of
data and compute-intensive research. We will present the basic
lessons that comprise the curriculum, and results from teaching them
at the inaugural workshop scheduled for May 2015. If successful, we
expect the workshops to be replicated through train-the-trainer
events, much similar to the [Software Carpentry][4] and [Data Carpentry][5]
workshops and teaching model.
